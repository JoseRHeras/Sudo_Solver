Attempt to implement a decision making algorithm. It uses a simple interface
on the cmd to provide a basic visual interface. 

My goal through out this project is to gain knowledge of algorithms that are
used in real world applications such as decision making.

With time I aim to make this project more efficient and user friendly. 

If you wish to use it for your own use feel free to do so. I also welcome any 
comments with regards to the project.
